/**
 * Tasks to implement
 * 
 * TODO: To make all the features DOM based and Dynamic
 * 
 * ? Keep code instances as consistent as possible for multi-purpose usage
 * ? Maintain all the python directories and in-directly connect all the python modules to the JS file and 
 * ? Keep the data-frames secure. This will help us to easily manipulate the methods over the python datasets.
 * ? All the datasets are having there duplicate files which will be used for analysis.
 * ? Python EEL linking will be done inside every method to make sure that the data-frames are accessed by right modules.
 * 
 * ! Keep code consistent, variable names should be meaningful
